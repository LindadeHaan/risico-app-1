## Install


## How to install

To install it, you will need to follow a few steps.

__- Clone it onto your computer.__  
First you want to change directory *in your terminal*, to the folder where you want to install the application.  
You can do so by running `cd` with the folder, in your terminal. For example:  
```cd server```
(if the folder is called *server*)

After this you want the clone the repository. You can doing by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jessiemasonx/risico-app.git
```

To make a package.json file you have to run the following in your terminal:
```
npm init
```
You will need to install the following __packages__ by running the `npm install` command in your terminal:

After this you will be able to see what packages you installed in your package.json file.

### Start server
Now you're able to start the server. Do this by running the following command:  
```
npm start
```

## Concept

## Proces

### First week

#### Monday
- Introduction day
- Learned about the location
- Arjan came to explain the project
- Drinks with class

#### Tuesday
I wasn't at school. But in the evening I made a top 3 of frameworks, based on what information I could find online.
1. Vue
2. React
3. Oolymer


#### Wednesday
- Found out I was going to be working with Polymer.
- Doing research on the framework Polymer.

#### Thursday
- Javascript bootcamp.
- Done more research on Polymer.
- Found a starter-kit to start a project.
- Looked al all the files and tried to understand new things.
- Looking at tutorials.
- Made my first component.

#### Friday
- Added and changed the pages.
- Added the first part of the forms.

### Second week

#### Monday
- Emergency workers came to tell us about their experience and what they're looking for in the app.

#### Tuesday
- Added more pages and finished putting all the selects with options in the forms. All the forms were now on the app.

#### Wednesday
- Nienke Dekker talked about why you use should use a framework. Very helpful.
- Made the localStorage work with lot's of help from Maikel and Chelsea. It was too difficult to figure out by myself.
- Put all the fieldsets of the forms in different components.

#### Thursday
- Added the formula to get the result in the end for the user.
- Added some more consistency.
- Changed the styling.
- Designed the prototype to be able to show parts of my concept that I couldn't put on the website because I didn't have enough time.

#### Friday
- Deadline day.



## Opinion
In the beginning of this project I was very happy about the fact that we were going to be working with different frameworks. I heard so much about them but had never really used any so I didn't really know what to expect.
But I was very curious and never really know why I would even use a framework and what to do with them. I'm glad that after this project I can now say I have experienced using a framework and I know what they are for.

## Experience
If I'm being completely honest, before this project started I didn't even know what a `component` was. They first few days I was so confused. Now that I have used them I realize why they are so useful. How I see it now is that components are basically pieces of code you can write once and then use in different parts, so you don't have to write the same piece of code all over again.

One of the hardest parts was that there wasn't that much documentation to be found on Polymer 3.0. I was very lucky that I had Maikel and Chelsea who were working with the same Framework, because otherwise I don't think I would've been able to do all this myself.
I find it hard to say I would recommend Polymer or not, because I can't really compare it to anything else because it's the only Framework i've been working with. I do know that Polymer doesn't work with states, and I learned about them from Nienke Dekker and realized how useful they are. Instead of using states, I had to store everything in the localStorage.
